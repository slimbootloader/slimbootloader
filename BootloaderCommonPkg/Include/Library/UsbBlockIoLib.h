  Reads the requested number of blocks from the specified block device.

  The function reads the requested number of blocks from the device. All the

  the function returns EFI_NO_MEDIA.

  @param[in]  DeviceIndex   Specifies the block device to which the function wants
                            to talk.
  @param[in]  StartLBA      The starting logical block address (LBA) to read from
                            on the device
  @param[in]  BufferSize    The size of the Buffer in bytes. This number must be

  @param[out] Buffer        A pointer to the destination buffer for the data.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The device reported an error while attempting
                                  to perform the read operation.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The read request contains LBAs that are not
                                  valid, or the buffer is not properly aligned.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA            There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The BufferSize parameter is not a multiple of
                                  the intrinsic block size of the device.
