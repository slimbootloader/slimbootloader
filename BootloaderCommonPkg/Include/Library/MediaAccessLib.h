/**
  Reads the requested number of blocks from the specified block device.

  The function reads the requested number of blocks from the device. All the
  blocks are read, or an error is returned. If there is no media in the device,
  the function returns EFI_NO_MEDIA.

  @param[in]  DeviceIndex   Specifies the block device to which the function wants
                            to talk.
  @param[in]  StartLBA      The starting logical block address (LBA) to read from
                            on the device
  @param[in]  BufferSize    The size of the Buffer in bytes. This number must be
                            a multiple of the intrinsic block size of the device.
  @param[out] Buffer        A pointer to the destination buffer for the data.
                            The caller is responsible for the ownership of the
                            buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED         The interface is not supported.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY           The MediaSetInterfaceType() has not been called yet.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The device reported an error while attempting
                                  to perform the read operation.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The read request contains LBAs that are not
                                  valid, or the buffer is not properly aligned.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA            There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The BufferSize parameter is not a multiple of
                                  the intrinsic block size of the device.
