/**
  Flush a range of  cache lines in the cache coherency domain of the calling
  CPU.

  Flushes the cache lines specified by Address and Length.  If Address is not aligned
  on a cache line boundary, then entire cache line containing Address is flushed.
  If Address + Length is not aligned on a cache line boundary, then the entire cache
  line containing Address + Length - 1 is flushed.  This function may choose to flush
  the entire cache if that is more efficient than flushing the specified range.  If
  Length is 0, the no cache lines are flushed.

  @param[in]  Address The base address of the lines to invalidate.

  @param[in]  Length  The number of bytes to invalidate from the cache.
