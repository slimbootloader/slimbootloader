/**
  Given a Lzma compressed source buffer, this function retrieves the size of
  the uncompressed buffer and the size of the scratch buffer required
  to decompress the compressed source buffer.

  Retrieves the size of the uncompressed buffer and the temporary scratch buffer
  required to decompress the buffer specified by Source and SourceSize.
  The size of the uncompressed buffer is returned in DestinationSize,
  the size of the scratch buffer is returned in ScratchSize, and RETURN_SUCCESS is returned.
  This function does not have scratch buffer available to perform a thorough
  checking of the validity of the source data. It just retrieves the "Original Size"
  field from the LZMA_HEADER_SIZE beginning bytes of the source data and output it as DestinationSize.
  And ScratchSize is specific to the decompression implementation.

  If SourceSize is less than LZMA_HEADER_SIZE, then ASSERT().

  @param  Signature       The signature to indicate the decompression algorithm.
  @param  Source          The source buffer containing the compressed data.
  @param  SourceSize      The size, in bytes, of the source buffer.
  @param  DestinationSize A pointer to the size, in bytes, of the uncompressed buffer
                          that will be generated when the compressed buffer specified
                          by Source and SourceSize is decompressed.
  @param  ScratchSize     A pointer to the size, in bytes, of the scratch buffer that
                          is required to decompress the compressed buffer specified
                          by Source and SourceSize.

  @retval  RETURN_SUCCESS The size of the uncompressed data was returned
                          in DestinationSize and the size of the scratch
                          buffer was returned in ScratchSize.
