  Gets a block device's media information.

  This function will provide the caller with the specified block device's media
  information. If the media changes, calling this function will update the media
  information accordingly.

                             to talk.
  @param[out] DevBlockInfo   The Block Io information of the specified block partition.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS        The Block Io information about the specified block device
                             was obtained successfully.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The read request contains LBAs that are not
