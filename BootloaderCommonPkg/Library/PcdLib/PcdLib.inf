# Instance of PCD Library using PCD PPI.
#
# There are two PCD PPIs as follows:
#   1) PCD_PPI
#      It is EDKII implementation which support Dynamic/DynamicEx Pcds.
#   2) EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI
#      It is defined by PI specification 1.2, Vol 3 which only support dynamicEx
#      type Pcd.
# For dynamicEx type PCD, it is compatible between PCD_PPI and EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI.
# This library instance uses the PCD_PPI to handle dynamic PCD request and use
# EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI to handle dynamicEx type PCD.
#
# This library instance assume the PCD_PPI and EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI are both installed early.
#
# PCD Library that uses the PCD PPI to access Dynamic and DynamicEx PCD entries
