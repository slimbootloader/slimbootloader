  Gets a block device's media information.

  This function will provide the caller with the specified block device's media
  information. If the media changes, calling this function will update the media
  information accordingly.

                             to talk.
  @param[out] DevBlockInfo   The Block Io information of the specified block partition.

/**
  Reads the requested number of blocks from the specified block device.

  The function reads the requested number of blocks from the device. All the
  blocks are read, or an error is returned. If there is no media in the device,
  the function returns EFI_NO_MEDIA.

  @param[in]  DeviceIndex   Specifies the block device to which the function wants
                            to talk.
  @param[in]  StartLBA      The starting logical block address (LBA) to read from
                            on the device
  @param[in]  BufferSize    The size of the Buffer in bytes. This number must be
                            a multiple of the intrinsic block size of the device.
  @param[out] Buffer        A pointer to the destination buffer for the data.
                            The caller is responsible for the ownership of the
                            buffer.
