Slim Bootloader
================

**Welcome to the Slim Bootloader project!**

Slim Bootloader is an open-source boot firmware solution, built from the
ground up to be secure, lightweight, and highly optimized while leveraging
robust tools and libraries from the [EDK II](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2/)
framework.

What is a Bootloader?
---------------------
Just like a typical [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS), Slim Bootloader
is the piece of software responsible for initializing the core hardware
components of the system when it is powered on, followed by the loading and
launching of the desired operating system.

Slim Bootloader offers the flexibility for OEMs, device manufacturers, and hobbyists
to isolate, configure, and optimize for the the specific requirements of the system
thereby achieving unparalleled boot performance and minimizing firmware footprint.
