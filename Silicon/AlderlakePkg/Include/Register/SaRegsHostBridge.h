    "_SA_[generation_name]_" in register/bit names. e.g., "_SA_HSW_"
  - Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_[SKU_name]"
    at the end of the register/bit names
  - Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a SA generation will be just named
    as "_SA_" without [generation_name] inserted.

 Description:
  This is the base address for the PCI Express configuration space.  This window of addresses contains the 4KB of configuration space for each PCI Express device that can potentially be part of the PCI Express Hierarchy associated with the Uncore.  There is no actual physical memory within this window of up to 256MB that can be addressed.  The actual size of this range is determined by a field in this register.
  Each PCI Express Hierarchy requires a PCI Express BASE register.  The Uncore supports one PCI Express Hierarchy.  The region reserved by this register does not alias to any PCI2.3 compliant memory mapped space.  For example, the range reserved for MCHBAR is outside of PCIEXBAR space.
  On reset, this register is disabled and must be enabled by writing a 1 to the enable field in this register.  This base address shall be assigned on a boundary consistent with the number of buses (defined by the length field in this register), above TOLUD and still within 39-bit addressable memory space.
  The PCI Express Base Address cannot be less than the maximum address written to the Top of physical memory register (TOLUD).  Software must guarantee that these ranges do not overlap with known ranges located above TOLUD.
  Software must ensure that the sum of the length of the enhanced configuration region + TOLUD + any other known ranges reserved above TOLUD is not greater than the 39-bit addessable limit of 512GB.  In general, system implementation and the number of PCI/PCI Express/PCI-X buses supported in the hierarchy will dictate the length of the region.

 Description of DMIBAR (12:38)
 - This field corresponds to bits 38 to 12 of the base address DMI configuration space. BIOS will program this register resulting in a base address for a 4KB block of contiguous memory address space. This register ensures that a naturally aligned 4KB space is allocated within the first 512GB of addressable memory space. System Software uses this base address to program the DMI register set. All the Bits in this register are locked in LT mode.

 Description:
 - This register determines the Base Address register of the memory range that is pre-allocated to the Manageability Engine.  Together with the MESEG_MASK register it controls the amount of memory allocated to the ME.
 - This register must be initialized by the configuration software.  For the purpose of address decode address bits A[19:0] are assumed to be 0. Thus, the bottom of the defined memory address range will be aligned to a 1MB boundary.
 - This register is locked by LT.

 - This field indicates the bits that must match MEBASE in order to qualify as an ME Memory Range access.
 - For example, if the field is set to 7FFFFh, then ME Memory is 1MB in size.
 - Another example is that if the field is set to 7FFFEh, then ME Memory is 2MB in size.
 - In other words, the size of ME Memory Range is limited to power of 2 times 1MB.

/**
 Description:
 - This register controls the read, write and shadowing attributes of the BIOS range from F_0000h to F_FFFFh.  The Uncore allows programmable memory attributes on 13 legacy memory segments of various sizes in the 768KB to 1MB address range.  Seven Programmable Attribute Map (PAM) registers are used to support these features.  Cacheability of these areas is controlled via the MTRR register in the core.
 - Two bits are used to specify memory attributes for each memory segment.  These bits apply to host accesses to the PAM areas.  These attributes are:
 - RE - Read Enable.  When RE=1, the host read accesses to the corresponding memory segment are claimed by the Uncore and directed to main memory.  Conversely, when RE=0, the host read accesses are directed to DMI.
 - WE - Write Enable.  When WE=1, the host write accesses to the corresponding memory segment are claimed by the Uncore and directed to main memory.  Conversely, when WE=0, the host read accesses are directed to DMI.
 - The RE and WE attributes permit a memory segment to be Read Only, Write Only, Read/Write or Disabled.  For example, if a memory segment has RE=1 and WE=0, the segment is Read Only.
