  Set PCH LPC/eSPI generic IO range.
  For generic IO range, the base address must align to 4 and less than 0xFFFF, and the length must be power of 2
  and less than or equal to 256. Moreover, the address must be length aligned.
  This function basically checks the address and length, which should not overlap with all other generic ranges.
  If no more generic range register available, it returns out of resource error.
  This cycle decoding is also required on DMI side
  Some IO ranges below 0x100 have fixed target. The target might be ITSS,RTC,LPC,PMC or terminated inside P2SB
  but all predefined and can't be changed. IO range below 0x100 will be rejected in this function except below ranges:

    0x68-0x6F,

    0xC0-0xFF

  1. Program LPC/eSPI PCI Offset 84h ~ 93h of Mask, Address, and Enable.
  2. Program LPC/eSPI Generic IO Range in DMI
