  Register names for Host Bridge block
  <b>Conventions</b>:
  - Prefixes:
    - Definitions beginning with "R_" are registers
    - Definitions beginning with "B_" are bits within registers
    - Definitions beginning with "V_" are meaningful values of bits within the registers
    - Definitions beginning with "S_" are register sizes
    - Definitions beginning with "N_" are the bit position
  - In general, SA registers are denoted by "_SA_" in register names
  - Registers / bits that are different between SA generations are denoted by
    "_SA_[generation_name]_" in register/bit names. e.g., "_SA_HSW_"
  - Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_[SKU_name]"
    at the end of the register/bit names
  - Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a SA generation will be just named
    as "_SA_" without [generation_name] inserted.

/**
 <b>Description</b>:
 - This is the base address for the Host Memory Mapped Configuration space.  There is no physical memory within this 32KB window that can be addressed.  The 32KB reserved by this register does not alias to any PCI 2.3 compliant memory mapped space.  On reset, the Host MMIO Memory Mapped Configuation space is disabled and must be enabled by writing a 1 to MCHBAREN [Dev 0, offset48h, bit 0].
 - All the bits in this register are locked in LT mode.
 - The register space contains memory control, initialization, timing, and buffer strength registers; clocking registers; and power and thermal management registers.

/**
 Description of GMS (8:15)
 - This field is used to select the amount of Main Memory that is pre-allocated to support the Internal Graphics device in VGA (non-linear) and Native (linear) modes.  The BIOS ensures that memory is pre-allocated only when Internal graphics is enabled.
 - This register is also LT lockable.
 - Valid options are 0 (0x0) to 2048MB (0x40) in multiples of 32 MB
 - All other values are reserved
 - Hardware does not clear or set any of these bits automatically based on IGD being disabled/enabled.
 - BIOS Requirement: BIOS must not set this field to 0h if IVD (bit 1 of this register) is 0.

/**
 Description of GGMS (6:7)
 - This field is used to select the amount of Main Memory that is pre-allocated to support the Internal Graphics Translation Table.  The BIOS ensures that memory is pre-allocated only when Internal graphics is enabled.
 - GSM is assumed to be a contiguous physical DRAM space with DSM, and BIOS needs to allocate a contiguous memory chunk.  Hardware will derive the base of GSM from DSM only using the GSM size programmed in the register.
 - Valid options:
 - 0h: 0 MB of memory pre-allocated for GTT.
 - 1h: 2 MB of memory pre-allocated for GTT.
 - 2h: 4 MB of memory pre-allocated for GTT.
 - 3h: 8 MB of memory pre-allocated for GTT.
 - Others: Reserved
 - Hardware functionality in case of programming this value to Reserved is not guaranteed.
